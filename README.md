# Samping-and-holding
This repo demonstrates how to sample an analog signal  before it gets quantified. I'll be using the arduino IDE to create the script that outputs a sine, ramp or triangular waveforms that will be sampled via a S/H circuit.

Hardware needed:

8-bit R2R Digital to analog converter.
Arduino uno or nano board.
Sampling and holding circuit.
An oscilloscope to see the sampled waveforms if you want to, but they can also be printed on the serial monitor.

Software needed:

Arduino IDE.

The schematics are attached on this repository.
